# The project "Deploying the site locally" 

- The program can be deployed locally on your computer and connected to a database with employee visits.
- The program displays information on the "security panel" about active employee passes.
- The program displays information about the employee's time in the place of interest to us.
- The program displays information about employees who are currently in the place of interest to us.

### Software environment and installation:

Python3 should already be installed.

### Program installation:

Download the code: [https://github.com/VAChess777/Lesson_1_the_bank_panel_Getting_to_know_Django_ORM_Devman](https://github.com/VAChess777/Lesson_1_the_bank_panel_Getting_to_know_Django_ORM_Devman), or clone the `git` repository to a local folder:
```
https://github.com/VAChess777/Lesson_1_the_bank_panel_Getting_to_know_Django_ORM_Devman
```

### Installing dependencies:
 
Use `pip` (or `pip3`, if there is a conflict with Python2) to install dependencies:
```bach
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### About environment variables:

The program ```main.py``` has an environment variable `os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'project.settings')`, which is responsible for configuring access to the database. The setup is carried out in the program `settings.py`

### How to run the program:

Run the script ```main.py``` with the command:
```bach
$ python main.py
```
Log in to your browser at [127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000), and you will see the information of the 'security console.'

### How the program works:

The program consists of 7 script:

```main.py``` - the main program that runs the script.   
```active_passcards_view.py``` - the program is located in the datacenter folder. The program shows how many active passes are available.                                             
```storage_information_view.py``` - the program is located in the datacenter folder. The program shows information about employees who are in the vault, and how long they are there.                           
```passcard_info_view.py``` - the program is located in the datacenter folder. The program calculates information about how many visits to the repository the employee of interest had, and was this visit suspicious.   
```settings.py``` - the program is located in the project folder. Responsible for setting up access to the employee database.   
```models.py``` - the program is located in the datacenter folder. The program is responsible for data models and their fields
```urls.py``` - the program is located in the project folder. Responsible for setting up links to the 'security console' pages
            
### Features works of the program:

The `active_passcards_view.py` program contains the functions:

* The `active_passcards_view` function - get active employee passes from the database.

The `storage_information_view.py` program contains the functions:

* The `storage_information_view` function - calculates information about how many visits to the repository the employee of interest had, and was this visit suspicious.
* The `get_duration` function - gets the difference between the start of the visit and the time when the employee left the object.
* The `format_duartion` function - formats the information received from the function `get_duration`.

The `passcard_info_view.py` program contains the functions:

* The `passcard_info_view` function - receives information about the visits of each employee. Calculates whether this visit was suspicious.
* The `get_object_or_404` function - checks the correctness of the entered passcard number.
* The `is_visit_long` function - compares the employee's stay time with the time we are interested in visiting the object.
